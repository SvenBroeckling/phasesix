It's Magic!

Your campaign should contain magic? So don't get me wrong, don't confuse magic with divine work or even body modifications. Magic is a strange power, which can be represented quite differently depending on the universe.

In ancient or medieval times, adding magic may make the campaign feel more like a fantasy world. In the modern era, magic may add to a cthulhuid story; in the future, it may lead to a setting like the Seattle of 2052 described in various stories.

The magic expansion is independent of eras or other expansions. It can be added at any time to enable magic in the campaign.

### Basic Attributes

The magic expansion is based on two basic attributes, which characters with the expansion activated have and which can be obtained through templates.

#### Arcana

*Arcana* reflects the amount of magic the character can combine and store. With *Arcana*, the character casts spells and performs rituals. Templates, such as "Arcane Tutor" increase the maximum arcana a character can have.

*Arkana* regenerates through a rest.

#### Spell Points

*Spell points* are used to create spells. *Spell points* can also be obtained by the character through templates. For example, the "Arcane School" template gives 10 spell points.

Once *spell points* are spent on a spell, they are used up and cannot be used again. Unlike *Arcana*, this is not a value that refreshes by resting.


### Skills

With the magic expansion, each character gains two new skills that they can use to act in the magical world.

#### Spell Casting

The skill *Spell Casting* is used to perform spells and rituals. It is composed of the attributes *Willpower* and *Charm* and can be increased by templates. 

#### Magic Knowledge

*Magic Knowledge* is used whenever knowledge of magical occurrences or artifacts is needed. Every character has this skill, which is composed of *Education* and *Conscientiousness*.

### Learning spells

To learn a spell, a character needs three things: rest (a spell can only be learned between game sessions) and available spell points. In addition, he needs a thesis, a way to also get the knowledge about that spell. The latter is up to the campaign, or the game master.

*Spell points* are available when the number of *Spell points* spent is less than the *Spell points* obtained through templates. Each spell has a certain point cost. To learn it, the spell is noted on the character sheet as learned.

A spell can be learned multiple times. This is possible because spells can be modified by spell templates. For example, you can make an energy lightning spell once as an energy spell and once as a light spell.

#### Spell values

A spell has different values, which are taken into account in the game.

The *spell casting attribute* specifies which attribute (along with the *spell* value) is rolled on to cast the spell. It is given by the school of magic (see below).

The value under *Arcana* describes the cost of the spell when cast. To cast a spell with an *arcana* value of 2, the player must also have two arcana available and cross off when casting.

The *strength* of the spell describes how effective the spell is. For newly learned spells, the strength is usually 1, but can be increased by spell templates. In addition, the strength is increased by the successes of the spell casting when the spell is cast (see Casting Spells).

Each spell has a certain *range*. This is the maximum distance from the caster at which a spell can be cast. This is not to be confused with a possible area where the spell will work. This is mentioned in the spell description. If the *range* of a spell is 0, the spell only works at/on the caster himself.

The *shape* of the spell determines the area of effect. It can be a geometric shape, such as a line or a sphere, or no specific shape. The latter is the case if the spell requires touch or works directly on the caster.

The *Actions* of a spell indicate how many actions are required to cast the spell.

#### Schools

Spells in Phase Six are assigned to schools, which classify spells into broad categories. Each character can choose spells from any school, but the school is assigned a supporting attribute in each case.

* Damage *(Strength)*
* Control *(Willpower)*
* Transmutation *(Skill)*
* Healing *(Conscientiousness)*
* Illusion *(Quickness)*
* Divination *(Apprehension)*
* Revocation *(Logic)*
* Summoning *(Charm)*
* Enchantment *(Attractiveness)*


### Spell templates

Spell templates change the values of a spell, and can also add effects or completely change the behavior of the spell. Spell templates are divided into four categories:

* Basic: basic adjustments to spells.
  * Powerful spell (1 spell point): The power of the spell is increased by one.
  * Easy to Perform (5 spell points): The spell requires 1 arcana less, but at least 1 arcana.
  * Twin spell (5 spell points): The spell affects one additional target. The effect is applied to all targets.
  * Long Range (2 spell points): The range of the spell is increased by 20 meters.
  * Fast Execution (3 spell points): The spell requires one less action, but at least 1 action.
* Affinity (1 spell point): The element of the spell is changed. This initially has no effect in the game mechanics, but it can turn an acid spell into a fire spell, for example.
* Shape (3 spell points): changes the shape of the spell, for example from a point to a sphere of certain diameter.
* School (7 spell points): changes the school of the spell, for example from incantation to damage. This also changes the attribute on which what is cast.

Spell templates can be added to any learned spell. To do this, note on the character sheet at the spell that it contains the special template, e.g. "Simple Healing (Powerful Spell)".

Each spell template can also be added to a spell more than once.

### Forgetting spells

Just like learning spells, it is possible to forget spells with the necessary peace of mind. To do this, the spell is removed from the character sheet, and the character can be credited again for the spell points used.

### Cast a spell

A spell can be cast if the character still has at least the arcana specified with the spell available.

To cast a spell, the player casts on the *Spell Casting* value specified with the spell. This value is made up of the character's *Spell Casting* skill and the spell school's attribute.

If the roll achieves at least one success, the spell is successful. For each success achieved, the *Power of the spell* is now increased by one.

The effect of the spell occurs as indicated in the description. The specified arcana cost is deducted from the character, even if the spell failed.

> Luta wants to cast a simple heal. Her *Spell Casting* value is 1, in the attribute *Conscientiousness* (which is the attribute of the healing school) she has 5. She thus has 6 dice available for casting the spell.
> 
> She rolls a result of 3,4,5,5,3,1. Thus she has achieved 2 successes, which are added to the *Power* of the spell. She thus heals 3 wounds.


### Magic artifacts

In addition to spells, the magic expansion also brings the possibility of magic items, weapons, armor or weapon modifications. These are treated like normal items, the description shows the exact handling.

For example, a *Simple Healing Potion* restores 1W3 wounds when used.
