It's Magic!

Your campaign should contain magic? So don't get me wrong, don't confuse magic with divine work or even body modifications. Magic is a strange power, which can be represented quite differently depending on the universe.

In ancient or medieval times, adding magic may make the campaign feel more like a fantasy world. In the modern era, magic may add to a Cthulhuiden story; in the future, it may lead to a setting like the Seattle of 2052 described in various stories.

The magic expansion is independent of eras or other expansions. It can be chosen at any time to enable magic in the campaign.

### Basic Attributes

The Magic expansion is based on two basic attributes, which characters with the expansion activated automatically have and which can be obtained through templates.

#### Arcana

Arcana reflects the amount of magic the character can combine and store. With arcana, the character casts spells and performs rituals. Templates, such as "Arcane Teacher" increase the maximum possible arcana a character can have.

Arcana regenerates by resting.

#### Spell Points

Spell points are used to create spells. Spell points can also be obtained by the character through templates. For example, the "Arcane School" template gives 10 spell points.

Once spell points are spent on a spell, they are used up and cannot be used again. Unlike arcana, this is not a value that refreshes by resting.
