The physical integrity of the character is represented in the form of wounds. A character can withstand a certain number of wounds without passing out. 

### Wounds and Boosts

If you look at the character sheet of an intact character, you will see a bar of filled hearts:

<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>

These hearts represent the wounds a character can take without passing out. Each source of damage causes a certain number of wounds. This can be a fixed number of wounds, as with most weapons. However, a dice formula can also be used. 

Hearts are crossed out or emptied as soon as the character takes wounds. Thus, after a hit with a weapon, the life meter may evolve as follows:

<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="far fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="far fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>

These empty hearts can be filled again through healing. 

The situation is different with boosts. Some items give boosts when used, pure first aid without tools gives a boost, for example. Boosts are represented as different colored hearts and can also absorb wounds when crossed out. 

However, with boosts, these hearts are completely removed and cannot be restored by healing. Thus, a boost is a temporary improvement in condition.

If the character takes damage, it is always crossed out from the right. First the boosts are used up, then the still complete hearts. So in the following display, the boost occurred *after* the wounding (the empty hearts).

### Fainting and Death

A character who has neither full hearts nor boosts faints and is considered *dying*.

### Healing

Real healing of wounds is only possible over time and with medicine. First aid and the use of bandages and other aids only generate boosts. 

Using the first aid skill without aids generates a boost. With aids the number varies, this is described in the items. 

### The rest

If the characters come to rest for at least 6 hours, this is considered a *rest*.

During a rest, the character has the opportunity to heal wounds. For this purpose, the values *Resistance*, *Endurance* and *Willpower* are added together. Dice are rolled according to the sum, for each success the character heals one wound.

All *bonus dice*, *destiny dice* and *rerolls* refresh, so are set to the character's maximum.

If the magic extension is used, the character rolls on the sum of the *Charm*, *Conscientiousness*, and *Willpower* stats. For each success, one *arcana* is restored.

When horror extension is active, the character rolls on the sum of *willpower* and *logic*. For each success, the stress can be reduced by one.

### Conditions of the character

A character can have different conditions. These have different effects on the character's actions, but also effects over time. The conditions are noted on the character sheet with a counter.

#### Dying

This condition is only caused when the character's wounds exceed the maximum wounds, so the hearts drop to 0. 

If a character falls into the dying condition, he rolls as many dice as the added value of *endurance* and *resistance*. The result gives the minutes a companion has to stabilize the character. If the time is up, the character dies.

Stabilizing requires successes according to the character's "Dying" value. This can be first aid, medicine, or something similarly helpful.

#### Shocked

The character has as many dice less for each roll as the value of this status effect.

#### Exhausted

The character has one *action* less per round in combat.

If the actions drop to 0, the character gets the condition *Unconscious*.

#### Unconscious

The character is incapable of any action (his *actions* per round are zero), but can roll a *willpower* test at the beginning of his combat round. Each success restores one action until all actions are restored.

#### Burning

The character receives one wound for each level of this condition at the end of the combat round (or after 5 minutes if not in combat). 

The character's minimum roll is increased by the value of this condition for all rolls for *Perception*.

#### Bleeding

The character receives one wound for each level of this condition at the end of the combat round (or after 5 minutes if not in combat). 

#### Poisoned

The character receives one wound for each level of this condition at the end of the combat round (or after 5 minutes if not in combat).

The character's minimum roll is increased by the value of this condition for all rolls.
