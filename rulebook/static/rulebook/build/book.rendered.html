            <h2>Your character</h2>
            <div class="chapter-text">
                <p>To accomplish a Phase Six adventure, each player creates a character to play in the adventure. The character's life is represented entirely on his character sheet, which contains all the relevant stats.</p>

<p>The chapter <em>Creating a Character</em> explains exactly how to create a new character. This part will deal with the basic characteristics that make up a character in Phase Six. </p>

<h3>Persona</h3>

<p>The values listed under Persona refer to the character's mental traits. Each value corresponds to a character trait. Persona traits each have their own value and are also the basis for skills.</p>

<h4>Education</h4>

<p>Education describes the character's acquired general knowledge.  A character with high education is good in all theoretical skills like <em>nature</em> or <em>history</em>.</p>

<h4>Logic</h4>

<p>In contrast to education, the value Logic represents the ability to <em>reasonably conclude</em>. Logic always comes into play when solving problems through logical reasoning. In addition, a character with high Logic is better at skills such as <em>Investigation</em> or <em>Mechanics</em>.</p>

<h4>Conscientiousness</h4>

<p>How conscientious is the character about tasks or activities? Weak conscientiousness makes the character <em>negligent</em>, while strong conscientiousness makes for an <em>organized</em>, <em>effective</em> approach.</p>

<h4>Willpower</h4>

<p>Willpower refers to the character's ability to assert their own ideas and principles. A strong-willed character is good at the skills <em>Courage</em> and <em>Intimidation</em>, among others.</p>

<h4>Apprehension</h4>

<p>Apprehension describes how well the character is able to perceive his environment and absorb information. A character with good Perception is good at the skills <em>Perception</em> and <em>Orientation</em>.</p>

<h4>Charm</h4>

<p>A character with high charm knows how to face other people and appear positive to them. This value is not to be confused with the physical trait <em>Attractiveness</em>. A Charming character is good at <em>Politics</em> and <em>Empathy</em> among other things.</p>

<h3>Physis</h3>

<p>All physis attributes describe the physical condition of the character. Physis attributes each have a value that specifies the number of dice to roll on that physique attribute.</p>

<h4>Deftness</h4>

<p>This value describes both the physical skill of the character and dexterity. A dexterous character is good at <em>Performance</em> and <em>Stealth</em>, among other things.</p>

<h4>Strength</h4>

<p>Strength is the pure strength of the character and is always used when it comes to moving something with pure muscle power. A character with high strength can <em>throw</em> well and is good at <em>athletics</em>.</p>

<h4>Attractiveness</h4>

<p>Attractiveness shows how charismatic the character is. A high value does not necessarily stand for beauty, a character with a striking appearance can also be attractive.</p>

<h4>Endurance</h4>

<p>Endurance is the physical stamina of the character, so not in the sense of patience (this is rather <em>conscientiousness</em>) under Persona. So this value comes into play during an endurance run or a long, strenuous activity. </p>

<h4>Resistance</h4>

<p>Both the ability to withstand or avert injury or pain, and resistance to disease, toxins, or environmental influences such as heat or cold, flow together in this value. </p>

<h4>Quickness</h4>

<p>Speed is both the speed at which the character can move and the ability to react quickly to something.</p>

<h3>The minimum roll</h3>

<p>The minimum roll is a central property of your character. It specifies what result a die must reach to represent a success. The minimum roll is inherited from the lineage and is 5+ for most characters. It can only be changed by special events or rare objects, and often only for a short time.</p>

<h3>Protection and evasion</h3>

<p>Both values are used in combat to prevent possible damage. The initial values of these traits are taken from the lineage, they can be changed by templates. The <em>Protection</em> reduces damage taken in combat, <em>Evasion</em> allows to dodge a melee attack. Both values are usually changed by armor as well.</p>

<h3>Additional dice</h3>

<p>Each character can have a number of <em>bonus dice</em>, <em>destiny dice</em> or <em>rerolls</em>. All three have different uses (see Rolls and Checks), but always represent an advantage to the character that can be used during the game. </p>

<p>The character can regain used dice during the rest (see Wounds and healing).</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>

<p>More complex actions or knowledge are described by <em>skills</em>. All characters have the same skills with different values. Each skill is composed of a base value and its own skill value. The base value is the average value of two, respectively different, attributes. For example, the base of the skill <em>Intimidate</em> is <em>Apprehension</em> and <em>Conscientiousness</em>. </p>

<p>The bonuses of the selected character templates are added to the base skill.</p>

<h3>Knowledge</h3>

<p>Knowledge works similarly to skills, but here the list is not predetermined. Characters can have different knowledge skills based on their background, which they can use freely. Knowledge is related to one skill at a time. The effective value to roll on is composed of the knowledge value and the skill value.</p>

<h3>Shadows</h3>

<p>A character can have special properties that affect him outside of his physical or psychological characteristics. Each <em>shadow</em> brings its own description or rule. For example, a character may have a rival or be obedient to authority. Shadows are not rolled on, nor do shadows have values, but they can bring their own rules.</p>

            <h2>Create a character</h2>
            <div class="chapter-text">
                <p>To create a character, you compose the career using <em>templates</em>. There are no ready-made character classes or profiles, instead the character is constructed freely.</p>

<h3>Lineage and career points</h3>

<p>A Phase Six character always has an ancestry. For all humans (and thus for most adventures), this is the "human" lineage, but there may also be elves, dwarves, androids, or robots in other settings. </p>

<p>The ancestry determines the starting values of the following traits of the character:</p>

<h5>Base Game</h5>

<ul>
<li>Career points (50)</li>
<li>Actions (2)</li>
<li>Persona and physis traits (1)</li>
<li>Minimum roll (5+)</li>
<li>Bonus, destiny and rerolls (0)</li>
<li>Basic protection (0)</li>
<li>Evasion (1)</li>
<li>Maximum Health (6)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Magic Extension</h5>

<ul>
<li>Arcana (0)</li>
<li>Spell points (0)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Horror Extension</h5>

<ul>
<li>Maximum stress (8)</li>
</ul>

<p>The values in parentheses indicate a human's starting values.</p>

<p>With the career points, templates can be composed during character creation, which make up the career and thus all the values of the character. </p>

<h3>Extensions and epochs</h3>

<p>At the beginning of a Phase Six campaign or adventure, the game master determines the era in which the adventure is set. Phase Six has several earthly eras to choose from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Classical Antiquity</li>
<li>Middle Ages, Vikings and Crusades</li>
<li>Victorian Age and the Wild West</li>
<li>Imperialism and World Wars</li>
<li>The Cold War and the 80s</li>
<li>Modern times</li>
<li>Science Fiction</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the templates, the eras also define the equipment that characters can obtain. Medieval, Viking and Crusades can thus naturally be used for a fantasy setting that is not set on Earth.</p>

<p>In addition, there are freely selectable expansions, which can be chosen for a scenario or an adventure by the game master. These add special rules, items and templates to the game. The special expansions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Magic</li>
<li>Horror</li>
</ul>

<h3>Character templates</h3>

<p>A template is a specific station in the character's life. Each template is assigned to one of <em>Education</em>, <em>Occupation</em>, <em>Talent</em>, <em>Interests</em>, <em>Character</em> or <em>Environment</em>. </p>

<p><img src="img/template.png" alt="template" title="template" /></p>

<p>Each template changes a small number of the character's traits and skills for the better or worse, and can bring knowledge or shadow. In addition, templates can contain their own rules, which the character then adopts. The 
template <em>Blood Magic</em> from the Magic expansion, for example, also brings the rule to use wounds instead of arcana for casting spells. </p>

<p>One template can also depend on another, for example, the template <em>Military Academy</em> requires the occupation <em>Soldier</em>.</p>

<p>Each template is worth a certain number of career points. This is the number of points that must be spent to adopt the template into your own career. </p>

<p><img src="img/template1.png" alt="template" title="template" /></p>

<h3>Assemble templates</h3>

<p>To create a character, you choose templates from the chosen era and any expansions until there are no more career points left, or you are satisfied with the character. These templates can be composed arbitrarily from all categories. So you can also choose several occupations, these are in the character's career all the occupations he once practiced, or even still practicing in parallel. </p>

<p>The attributes, skills, shadows and knowledge of the templates are added together and added to the starting value of the ancestry in the character sheet. In this process, all values can also become negative (see "Throws and checks").</p>

<h3>Completing the character</h3>

<p>If you are satisfied with the composition of the templates, you can simply declare the character <em>finished</em>. If there are any development points left and not spent, they will be added to the character's <em>reputation</em> (see Advancement). So no points are lost. </p>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-image" style="background-image: url(img/rolls.jpg)">
                &nbsp;
            </div>
            <h2>Rolls and checks</h2>
            <div class="chapter-text">
                <p>Whenever a character performs an action with an uncertain outcome, dice are rolled for a suitable value, which is usually determined by the game master. The outcome of the roll indicates whether and how well the action succeeded. This is called a <em>roll</em> or <em>check</em>.</p>

<p>Six-sided dice are used for all rolls. The number of dice is determined by the character's value in the trait in question, plus any bonus dice or fate dice. </p>

<p>So a check is a roll of a <em>number</em> of dice, with a <em>minimum roll</em> that must be achieved, which may be modified by a <em>level of difficulty</em>. We go into more detail about the elements below.</p>

<p>These types of checks are used everywhere outside of combat. In combat, separate rules apply for determining hits and wounds.</p>

<h3>The number of dice</h3>

<p>The required or desired skill directly determines the number of dice with its value. A character with an "Intimidate" value of 4 also has 4 six-sided dice available for this check.</p>

<p>The knowledge traits have a value with which they specify the number of dice. In addition, however, an associated skill is given here, and its value is added to the knowledge value. Thus, a character with the skill "Communication" 2 and the knowledge "Etiquette (Communication)" 3 has a total of 5 dice on Etiquette.</p>

<p>If the value is 0 or negative, the character is not able to make this roll without further help, he is simply too bad at the skill. However, <em>bonus dice</em> or <em>destiny dice</em> can be used, no matter how much the value is in the negative.</p>

<h3>The minimum roll</h3>

<p>The minimum roll is specified directly by the character. A human has a minimum roll of 5+, this can also be changed by special circumstances.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hagen's player wants to use brute force to effectively kick open a door that stands between him and the suspected gang of thieves. The game master asks him to make a roll for Strength.</p>
  
  <p>Hagen has a value of 4 in strength, so he rolls 4 dice. Any die that shows a 5 or higher is a success. A single success is sufficient for success, but Hagen's player rolls 4 successes, and immediately kicks the door in the face of the first thief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The minimum roll is given in the form "X+" to indicate that this is the die result, which is the minimum that must be achieved. </p>

<h3>Levels of difficulty</h3>

<p>The game master can modify the minimum roll for particularly easy or difficult checks. For difficult checks, a modifier can be announced as a roll+, and for easy checks, a roll-.</p>

<p>A +3 check in this case means that the minimum roll is raised by 3, so for a human it is 8+. This is where it comes into play that all rolls outside of combat are <em>exploding dice</em>.</p>

<h3>Exploding Dice</h3>

<p>It is possible in Phase Six for minimum rolls to exceed 6+, and in some cases to be much higher. Here, the rule of "Exploding Dice" applies to every roll outside of combat.</p>

<p>Dice that show a 6 after the roll may be rolled again. The result is then added together. Thus, a minimum roll of 9+ can be achieved on a single die by first rolling a 6, and then rolling at least a 3. A 14+ can only be achieved if on one die first a 6, then another 6, and then at least a 2 is rolled. </p>

<p>Since no distinction is made between the individual dice on a roll of multiple dice, all sixes can be rolled again at the same time if this is necessary to achieve a high minimum roll.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hagen's gamemaster requires him to make a Courage check +9, since he is facing the gang of thieves alone. So he must achieve a 14 on at least one die of his valor value. Fortunately, he has a Courage value of 5, so he has 5 dice at his disposal. </p>
  
  <p>In the first roll he rolls 4,2,6,6,1, so he has two sixes to roll to reach the 14. The second roll (with the two dice) shows a 6 and a 1. </p>
  
  <p>Now he may only roll the remaining die that showed a 6 again. Since this now shows a 1, even the pronounced courage does not help him, Hagen has only reached a 13.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Bonus dice</h3>

<p>A character can have a number of bonus dice. These are determined by the templates (see <em>Creating a Character</em>). Any number of the bonus dice can be added to the dice to be rolled. This can be done even if the actual roll has already failed. This way, one bonus die after the other can be sacrificed to possibly still lead to a success.</p>

<p>In this way, it is also possible to make a roll when the number of dice is actually 0 or less.</p>

<p>The bonus dice refresh to their maximum at each rest. </p>

<h3>Rerolls</h3>

<p>For each re-roll, a complete roll can be re-rolled. Thus, it is not possible to successfully pass a roll to 0 or less.</p>

<p>Rerolls also refresh to their maximum at each rest.</p>

<h3>Destiny dice</h3>

<p>As a rule, the character gets destiny dice with his career, but the game master can also assign individual destiny dice for special actions or on special occasions.</p>

<p>Destiny dice can be used both as bonus dice and as rerolls. On a destiny die, a result of 4 is <strong>always</strong> a success, regardless of the difficulty of the check.</p>

<p>Destiny dice must always be rolled separately from all normal dice to determine if they have reached 4+.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we look at the previous example with Hagen's roll on his valor (5 dice on 14+), a destiny die would help him a lot here, because it would actually only have to reach a 4+.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Destiny dice refresh to their maximum at every rest. </p>

<h3>Group rolls</h3>

<p>Whenever the group as a whole is required to pass a check, group rolls are used. For example, instead of asking each player to make an Apprehension check, the game master can ask the whole group to make an Apprehension check. If this check is successful, the effect applies to all characters in the group.</p>

<p>A successful group roll always requires a number of successes to be achieved. The game master tells how many successes must be achieved for a group roll to be successful. Then each player rolls on the required attribute or skill. </p>

<p>All the successes of each character are added up. If the required number of successes is reached, the check is successful.</p>

<p>In the case of a party roll, each party can use bonus, destiny, and reroll dice as usual. It is also possible to modify the minimum roll based on the severity of the check.</p>

<h3>Concealment</h3>

<p>A special roll is the roll on concealment. This comes into play when a person is watching a character and looking for certain conspicuous equipment. </p>

<p>Each piece of equipment has a concealment value. The higher this value, the more obvious that item is to see or recognize. </p>

<p>If a person now observes a character or the whole group, the item with the <em>highest</em> concealment value counts for the concealment roll. </p>

<p>The person observing now rolls a number of dice equal to their Perception value <em>plus</em> the determined Concealment value. If successful, the observer can spot a conspicuous object.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Combat</h2>
            <div class="chapter-text">
                <p>When it comes to combat, the game proceeds in rounds.</p>

<h3>Start of the combat</h3>

<p>As soon as a conflict arises, time is frozen, and the group decides the order in which the participants of the combat will act. </p>

<p>To do this, each participant rolls on a D6, and adds the <em>Quickness value</em>. Here also the rule of <em>Exploding Dice</em> applies. The participant with the highest score starts the combat, all others follow in the order of their scores. </p>

<p>If two participants have the same result, the <em>Quickness</em> value decides first, and if this is also identical, the <em>Deftness</em> value.</p>

<p>All participants of the combat have no actions available at the beginning of the combat. Only when they receive the <em>priority</em> for the first time their actions do refresh. </p>

<h3>Sequence of rounds</h3>

<p>The combat is divided into <em>combat rounds</em>. In each combat round, each participant gets <em>priority</em> once, i.e. it is his turn, and he can assign which <em>actions</em> he will perform. </p>

<p>The participant can perform an action for each of his available actions (see <em>Actor and Actions</em>), or save the action to react in the opponent's turn (see <em>Reactions</em>).</p>

<p>If the last participant has acted, the next <em>combat round</em> begins with the first participant. </p>

<h4>Actor and actions</h4>

<p>If it is a participant's turn, he has the <em>priority</em>, he is the <em>actor</em> at this moment.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the turn, the <em>actions</em> of the participant refresh. The number of the player's actions is taken from the player's lineage. Thus, a human has 2 actions available in combat. The actions per round can be expanded by templates.</p>

<p>"Refresh" therefore means that all actions are available again. If the participant has previously used up actions, for example by actions in previous combat rounds, he resets his available actions to the maximum.</p>

<p>Once the actions are refreshed, the participant can act in combat. To do this, he performs actions one after another, each action taking a certain number of <em>actions</em>. Actions can be, among others, the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>To <strong>attack</strong> with a weapon</li>
<li><strong>Parry</strong> with a weapon or object</li>
<li><strong>Reload</strong> a weapon</li>
<li><strong>Use</strong> an object</li>
<li><strong>Evade</strong> a melee attack</li>
<li><strong>Hunker</strong> or lay on the ground (Apply the "Hunkered" status effect, see "Wounds and healing").</li>
<li><strong>Stand up</strong></li>
<li><strong>Walk</strong> <em>Quickness</em> + 1 Meters (performing another action without consuming an action, but the minimum roll is raised by 2).</li>
<li><strong>Run</strong> <em>Quickness</em> * 2 + 1 meters.</li>
<li><strong>Crawl</strong> <em>Quickness</em> / 2 + 1 meters. The charakter needs to be <em>hunkered</em>. (see Wounds and healing: Status Effects)</li>
</ul>

<p>Actions should not be performed together, but always one after the other, as there are possible reactions.</p>

<h4>Reactions</h4>

<p>If an <em>actor</em> acts in combat, all participants who directly perceive the <em>actor</em> can react to this action.</p>

<p>To be able to react to an action, the following conditions must be met:</p>

<ul>
<li>The reacting participant must directly perceive the <em>actor</em>, i.e. hear, see, or otherwise become aware of his action.</li>
<li>The reacting participant still has unused <em>actions</em>. </li>
</ul>

<p>The reaction is executed immediately after the <em>actor's</em> action, but takes place practically simultaneously. There can only ever be one <em>reaction</em> by a participant to an <em>action</em>. However, any number of participants can react to the <em>actor</em> when they perceive its <em>action</em>. </p>

<p>Each <em>reaction</em> reduces the available <em>actions</em> of the reacting participant by one.</p>

<h3>Actions through bonus dice</h3>

<p>Bonus and destiny dice can be used in combat to gain or steal actions.</p>

<p>To gain an additional action, a <em>bonus die</em> can be subtracted. The additional action is available immediately, including for a reaction. </p>

<p>If a <em>destiny die</em> is spent, an action can be stolen from an opponent. This action is no longer available to the opponent in his current (or next, if it is not his turn) turn. The participant who spent the destiny dice has the action immediately available, even as a reaction.</p>

<p>Spending dice for actions does not itself take an action.</p>

<h3>Sequence of an attack</h3>

<p>Attacks with weapons are handled exactly the same in melee and ranged combat. The only difference is that attacks with melee weapons are rolled on the <em>Hand to Hand combat</em> skill, attacks with firearms are rolled on the <em>Shooting</em> skill, and attacks with throwing weapons are rolled on the <em>Throwing</em> skill.</p>

<h4>The hit roll</h4>

<p>To make an attack, a roll of a certain number of dice is made. The <em>minimum</em> roll of this die is equal to the <em>minimum</em> roll of the character.</p>

<p>The number of dice initially corresponds to the character's respective skill value (shooting, hand to hand combat, throwing).</p>

<p>The hit roll can also be changed by other circumstances. Different fire modes and firing at the wrong distance may cause the available dice to change.</p>

<p>Each success causes a <em>hit</em> to the target of the attack. How the target can prevent damage is described under <em>hit</em>.</p>

<h5>Bonus dice: Fire modes</h5>

<p>Modern weapons usually have different firing modes. If fire modes are specified for the weapon, the following rule can be used for the weapon. </p>

<p>It is assumed that the weapon is in semi-automatic or burst mode for a normal hit roll. In this mode, the weapon fires the specified number of rounds per action. For weapons with only fully automatic fire mode, this is assumed to be the default. </p>

<p>When firing in a mode other than the default mode, the number of shots and the accuracy of the weapon changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Single shot mode: +1 die</li>
<li>Semi-automatic mode: +2 dice</li>
<li>Full-auto: +4 dice, all the character's unspent actions must be used up for shots with this weapon, after which the combat round ends for him. No actions can be saved for reactions.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Minus die: Hit rolls at wrong distance.</h5>

<p>Each weapon has a specified distance at which it is effective. If the target's distance differs from that specified on the weapon, there is a penalty to the hit dice.</p>

<p>If the real shooting distance is less than the specified distance of the weapon, the attack is performed normally. If the distance is increased up to the double of the weapon, the hit dice of the hit roll are reduced by 2.</p>

<p>If the target's distance is more than twice the weapon's range away, it is not possible to shoot or attack at the target.</p>

<h4>Cover</h4>

<p>If parts of the attacked target are hidden from the view of the attacker, the rule of cover applies. It depends on how much the target is hidden. The cover is divided into 3 levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>4+ Cover: Most of the attacked target is hidden.</li>
<li>5+ cover: The attacked target is half hidden</li>
<li>6+ Cover: It is a bit harder to hit the attacked target behind light cover. This effect is achieved, among other things, by the "hunker" condition.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the attacked target has at least 6+ cover, it is entitled to a cover roll after the <em>hit roll</em>. For this, he rolls as many dice as the attacker had <em>hits</em>. For each success (on the minimum roll according to the cover), one hit is removed.</p>

<h4>Wounds and piercing</h4>

<p>Any success of the <em>hit roll</em>, which is not prevented by cover, is a <em>hit</em> on the target of the attack. Other circumstances can also cause <em>hits</em>, for example a grenade can cause "3 hits with 2 wounds each".</p>

<p>If a character takes <em>hits</em>, they are reduced by the target's <em>protection value</em>. The <em>protection</em> is reduced by the <em>piercing</em> of the attacker's weapon.</p>

<p>Any hit not prevented by the <em>protection value</em> becomes as many wounds as the weapon or effect specifies.</p>

<h4>Bonus wounds</h4>

<p>If bonus wounds are specified with the weapon, they are caused directly as soon as one of the weapon's regular hits is converted into a wound. Thus, they are added to the sum of the wounds, and do <em>not</em> represent the wounds per hit.</p>

<h4>Wounds</h4>

<p>A <em>wound</em> is added directly to the wounds taken. It can only be prevented if a <em>template</em>, equipment or other explicitly contains a rule that modifies wounds.</p>

<h4>Weaponless melee</h4>

<p>If the character attacks without a weapon, the player rolls hit dice equal to his <em>Hand to hand combat</em> value. The minimum roll is equal to the character's minimum roll, which is usually 5+.</p>

<p>If the character's <em>Strength</em> value is higher than 2, the successful attack causes 1 <em>bonus wound</em>.</p>

<p>If the character's <em>Quickness</em> value is higher than 2, the character adds one die to the roll. </p>

<p>The piercing of an unarmed melee attack is 0, and the range is 1 meter.</p>

<h4>Evasion</h4>

<p>The attacked character can dodge a melee attack as a reaction. This requires that the attacked character has an action available and can perceive the attacker. Thus, an attack from behind cannot be dodged.</p>

<p>To dodge an attack, the character rolls a die to his value in <em>Evasion</em> on his normal minimum roll. The character has completely dodged the attack if the roll is successful.</p>

<h3>Throwing objects</h3>

<p>If an object, such as a grenade, is thrown at a target, the character throws to its value in <em>Throwing</em>. The minimum roll is equal to the character's minimum roll, usually 5+.</p>

<p>If the roll results in at least one success, the character has hit his target.</p>

<h4>Deviation</h4>

<p>If the roll on <em>throwing</em> shows no success, then the roll has failed. In this case, a roll is made on the deviation. </p>

<p>First, a W12 is thrown to determine the direction of the deviation. The result of the throw gives the direction in the form of the "clock" as seen by the throwing character facing the target. A 3 thus deviates to the right of the target, as seen by the throwing character.</p>

<p>Then a D6 is thrown, which determines the distance of the deviation in meters.</p>

<p>The thrown object thus lands at the determined location.</p>

            <h2>Wounds and healing</h2>
            <div class="chapter-text">
                <p>The physical integrity of the character is represented in the form of wounds. A character can withstand a certain number of wounds without passing out. </p>

<h3>Wounds and Boosts</h3>

<p>If you look at the character sheet of an intact character, you will see a bar of filled hearts:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i></p>

<p>These hearts represent the wounds a character can take without passing out. Each source of damage causes a certain number of wounds. This can be a fixed number of wounds, as with most weapons. However, a dice formula can also be used. </p>

<p>Hearts are crossed out or emptied as soon as the character takes wounds. Thus, after a hit with a weapon, the life meter may evolve as follows:</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="far fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>
<i class="far fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i></p>

<p>These empty hearts can be filled again through healing. </p>

<p>The situation is different with boosts. Some items give boosts when used, pure first aid without tools gives a boost, for example. Boosts are represented as different colored hearts and can also absorb wounds when crossed out. </p>

<p>However, with boosts, these hearts are completely removed and cannot be restored by healing. Thus, a boost is a temporary improvement in condition.</p>

<p>If the character takes damage, it is always crossed out from the right. First the boosts are used up, then the still complete hearts. So in the following display, the boost occurred <em>after</em> the wounding (the empty hearts).</p>

<p><i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-danger"></i>

<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-info"></i>
<i class="fas fa-heart fa-2x text-info"></i></p>

<h3>Fainting and Death</h3>

<p>A character that has neither full hearts nor boosts faints and is considered <em>dying</em>. The condition below describes exactly how to proceed here.</p>

<h3>Healing</h3>

<p>Real healing of wounds is only possible over time and with medicine. First aid and the use of bandages and other aids only generate boosts. </p>

<p>Using the first aid skill without aids generates a boost. With aids the number varies, this is described in the items. </p>

<h3>The rest</h3>

<p>If the characters come to rest for at least 6 hours, this is considered a <em>rest</em>.</p>

<p>During a rest, the character has the opportunity to heal wounds. For this purpose, the values <em>Resistance</em>, <em>Endurance</em> and <em>Willpower</em> are added together. Dice are rolled according to the sum, for each success the character heals one wound.</p>

<p>All <em>bonus dice</em>, <em>destiny dice</em> and <em>rerolls</em> refresh, so are set to the character's maximum.</p>

<p>If the magic extension is used, the character rolls on the sum of the <em>Charm</em>, <em>Conscientiousness</em>, and <em>Willpower</em> stats. For each success, one <em>arcana</em> is restored.</p>

<p>When horror extension is active, the character rolls on the sum of <em>willpower</em> and <em>logic</em>. For each success, the stress can be reduced by one.</p>

<h3>Conditions of the character</h3>

<p>A character can have different conditions. These have different effects on the character's actions, but also effects over time. The conditions are noted on the character sheet with a counter.</p>

<h4>Dying</h4>

<p>This condition is caused when the character's wounds exceed the maximum wounds, so the hearts decrease to 0. At that moment, the value of this condition is set to 1.</p>

<p>If the value of the condition is one or higher, the character rolls for his <em>Resistance</em> at the beginning of each round. If this roll succeeds, nothing happens. If this roll fails, the value of the condition is raised by one.</p>

<p>If the value of the condition reaches 6, the character dies.</p>

<p>Stabilizing requires successes equal to the character's "Dying" value. This can be a roll on first aid, medicine, or something similarly helpful. If enough successes are achieved, the dying condition is removed.</p>

<h4>Unconscious</h4>

<p>The character is incapable of any action (his <em>actions</em> per turn are zero). The value of this condition indicates the depth of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each round, the character can roll on his <em>willpower</em>. If the roll shows successes according to the value of this condition, the value is set to 0 and the character wakes up.</p>

<h4>Shocked</h4>

<p>For each roll, the character has as many dice less than the value of this condition.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each round, the character can roll on his <em>Endurance</em>. He can reduce the value of the condition by the number of successes. If the condition reaches a value of 0 in the process, it is removed.</p>

<h4>Burning</h4>

<p>The character's minimum roll is increased by the value of this condition for all rolls on <em>perception</em> and for all attacks.</p>

<p>This condition ends when the character is extinguished.</p>

<h4>Bleeding</h4>

<p>At the beginning of each round, the character rolls for <em>Endurance</em>. If the roll fails, the character takes one wound for each level of this condition.</p>

<p>This condition ends when the character is bandaged (e.g. by <em>first aid</em>).</p>

<h4>Poisoned</h4>

<p>The character's minimum roll is increased by the value of this condition for all rolls.</p>

<p>At the beginning of each round, the character can roll for his <em>Resistance</em>. He can reduce the value of this condition by the number of successes. If the condition reaches a value of 0 in the process, it is removed.</p>

<h4>Hunkered</h4>

<p>The character has a 6+ cover (see combat rules).</p>

<p>All actions involving manual work (physis attributes, attacks and skills) have a +1 minimum roll.</p>

<p>It takes an action to hunker down or stand up.</p>

            <h2>Advancement</h2>
            <div class="chapter-text">
                <p>Over time, the character can gain experience and develop. This also happens on the basis of templates.</p>

<h3>Reputation</h3>

<p>Reputation represents how well known the character is. It is an indication of how likely it is that the character is known to the people he meets, as well as a value that says how much the character has experienced in his life.</p>

<p>Reputation is recorded in the form <em>used/collected</em>. All reputation you ever got is behind the slash, all reputation you used to increase is in front of it. As long as the used reputation is lower than the collected one, templates can be bought for the difference.</p>

<h4>Gaining reputation</h4>

<p>For successful adventures the character gets reputation. This is assigned by the game master and should be in the range of 5-10 for an adventure. </p>

<p>Reputation can also be given directly for individual actions. For example, a successful action or scene in the game can lead to the game master directly awarding a certain amount of reputation.</p>

<h3>Developing the character</h3>

<p>For the reputation gained, the player can buy templates from the areas of <em>character</em>, <em>interests</em>, <em>environment</em> and <em>talent</em> after each game session. It is not possible to add new templates from the areas of <em>occupation</em> and <em>education</em>.</p>

<p>This further development takes place after each game session, so it is also possible to add further templates to the character within an adventure.</p>

<p>These templates are recorded exactly as in the character creation and the changes in the values are calculated directly on the character sheet.</p>

            <h2>Magic</h2>
            <div class="chapter-text">
                <p>It's Magic!</p>

<p>Your campaign should contain magic? So don't get me wrong, don't confuse magic with divine work or even body modifications. Magic is a strange power, which can be represented quite differently depending on the universe.</p>

<p>In ancient or medieval times, adding magic may make the campaign feel more like a fantasy world. In the modern era, magic may add to a cthulhuid story; in the future, it may lead to a setting like the Seattle of 2052 described in various stories.</p>

<p>The magic expansion is independent of eras or other expansions. It can be added at any time to enable magic in the campaign.</p>

<h3>Basic Attributes</h3>

<p>The magic expansion is based on two basic attributes, which characters with the expansion activated have and which can be obtained through templates.</p>

<h4>Arcana</h4>

<p><em>Arcana</em> reflects the amount of magic the character can combine and store. With <em>Arcana</em>, the character casts spells and performs rituals. Templates, such as "Arcane Tutor" increase the maximum arcana a character can have.</p>

<p><em>Arkana</em> regenerates through a rest.</p>

<h4>Spell Points</h4>

<p><em>Spell points</em> are used to create spells. <em>Spell points</em> can also be obtained by the character through templates. For example, the "Arcane School" template gives 10 spell points.</p>

<p>Once <em>spell points</em> are spent on a spell, they are used up and cannot be used again. Unlike <em>Arcana</em>, this is not a value that refreshes by resting.</p>

<h3>Skills</h3>

<p>With the magic expansion, each character gains two new skills that they can use to act in the magical world.</p>

<h4>Spell Casting</h4>

<p>The skill <em>Spell Casting</em> is used to perform spells and rituals. It is composed of the attributes <em>Willpower</em> and <em>Charm</em> and can be increased by templates. </p>

<h4>Magic Knowledge</h4>

<p><em>Magic Knowledge</em> is used whenever knowledge of magical occurrences or artifacts is needed. Every character has this skill, which is composed of <em>Education</em> and <em>Conscientiousness</em>.</p>

<h3>Learning spells</h3>

<p>To learn a spell, a character needs three things: rest (a spell can only be learned between game sessions) and available spell points. In addition, he needs a thesis, a way to also get the knowledge about that spell. The latter is up to the campaign, or the game master.</p>

<p><em>Spell points</em> are available when the number of <em>Spell points</em> spent is less than the <em>Spell points</em> obtained through templates. Each spell has a certain point cost. To learn it, the spell is noted on the character sheet as learned.</p>

<p>A spell can be learned multiple times. This is possible because spells can be modified by spell templates. For example, you can make an energy lightning spell once as an energy spell and once as a light spell.</p>

<h4>Spell values</h4>

<p>A spell has different values, which are taken into account in the game.</p>

<p>The <em>spell casting attribute</em> specifies which attribute (along with the <em>spell</em> value) is rolled on to cast the spell. It is given by the school of magic (see below).</p>

<p>The value under <em>Arcana</em> describes the cost of the spell when cast. To cast a spell with an <em>arcana</em> value of 2, the player must also have two arcana available and cross off when casting.</p>

<p>The <em>strength</em> of the spell describes how effective the spell is. For newly learned spells, the strength is usually 1, but can be increased by spell templates. In addition, the strength is increased by the successes of the spell casting when the spell is cast (see Casting Spells).</p>

<p>Each spell has a certain <em>range</em>. This is the maximum distance from the caster at which a spell can be cast. This is not to be confused with a possible area where the spell will work. This is mentioned in the spell description. If the <em>range</em> of a spell is 0, the spell only works at/on the caster himself.</p>

<p>The <em>shape</em> of the spell determines the area of effect. It can be a geometric shape, such as a line or a sphere, or no specific shape. The latter is the case if the spell requires touch or works directly on the caster.</p>

<p>The <em>Actions</em> of a spell indicate how many actions are required to cast the spell.</p>

<h4>Schools</h4>

<p>Spells in Phase Six are assigned to schools, which classify spells into broad categories. Each character can choose spells from any school, but the school is assigned a supporting attribute in each case.</p>

<ul>
<li>Damage <em>(Strength)</em></li>
<li>Control <em>(Willpower)</em></li>
<li>Transmutation <em>(Skill)</em></li>
<li>Healing <em>(Conscientiousness)</em></li>
<li>Illusion <em>(Quickness)</em></li>
<li>Divination <em>(Apprehension)</em></li>
<li>Revocation <em>(Logic)</em></li>
<li>Summoning <em>(Charm)</em></li>
<li>Enchantment <em>(Attractiveness)</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Spell templates</h3>

<p>Spell templates change the values of a spell, and can also add effects or completely change the behavior of the spell. Spell templates are divided into four categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic: basic adjustments to spells.
<ul>
<li>Powerful spell (1 spell point): The power of the spell is increased by one.</li>
<li>Easy to Perform (5 spell points): The spell requires 1 arcana less, but at least 1 arcana.</li>
<li>Twin spell (5 spell points): The spell affects one additional target. The effect is applied to all targets.</li>
<li>Long Range (2 spell points): The range of the spell is increased by 20 meters.</li>
<li>Fast Execution (3 spell points): The spell requires one less action, but at least 1 action.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Affinity (1 spell point): The element of the spell is changed. This initially has no effect in the game mechanics, but it can turn an acid spell into a fire spell, for example.</li>
<li>Shape (3 spell points): changes the shape of the spell, for example from a point to a sphere of certain diameter.</li>
<li>School (7 spell points): changes the school of the spell, for example from incantation to damage. This also changes the attribute on which what is cast.</li>
</ul>

<p>Spell templates can be added to any learned spell. To do this, note on the character sheet at the spell that it contains the special template, e.g. "Simple Healing (Powerful Spell)".</p>

<p>Each spell template can also be added to a spell more than once.</p>

<h3>Forgetting spells</h3>

<p>Just like learning spells, it is possible to forget spells with the necessary peace of mind. To do this, the spell is removed from the character sheet, and the character can be credited again for the spell points used.</p>

<h3>Cast a spell</h3>

<p>A spell can be cast if the character still has at least the arcana specified with the spell available.</p>

<p>To cast a spell, the player casts on the <em>Spell Casting</em> value specified with the spell. This value is made up of the character's <em>Spell Casting</em> skill and the spell school's attribute.</p>

<p>If the roll achieves at least one success, the spell is successful. For each success achieved, the <em>Power of the spell</em> is now increased by one.</p>

<p>The effect of the spell occurs as indicated in the description. The specified arcana cost is deducted from the character, even if the spell failed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Luta wants to cast a simple heal. Her <em>Spell Casting</em> value is 1, in the attribute <em>Conscientiousness</em> (which is the attribute of the healing school) she has 5. She thus has 6 dice available for casting the spell.</p>
  
  <p>She rolls a result of 3,4,5,5,3,1. Thus she has achieved 2 successes, which are added to the <em>Power</em> of the spell. She thus heals 3 wounds.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Magic artifacts</h3>

<p>In addition to spells, the magic expansion also brings the possibility of magic items, weapons, armor or weapon modifications. These are treated like normal items, the description shows the exact handling.</p>

<p>For example, a <em>Simple Healing Potion</em> restores 1W3 wounds when used.</p>

            <h2>Horror</h2>
            <div class="chapter-text">
                <p>The horror expansion of Phase Six adds the classic horror elements to the game. Not only can characters load silver ammunition into their weapons, there are also creatures from the darkest imagination and obscure objects. </p>

<p>In addition, a character now has a possible stress level. If the non-worldly encounters are too much there is a risk that the character will lose control, or even acquire a permanent mental disorder.</p>

<h3>Stress</h3>

<p>If the horror enhancement is activated, the character has a value for stress that starts at 0. In addition, the character has a value for the maximum stress he can handle. This value is 6 from the start, but can be changed by templates or other means.</p>

<p>The character can gain stress by encountering otherworldly entities or having other encounters that are so abnormal that they affect him.</p>

<p>If the character reaches his maixmal stress level by an action, he gets a <em>tick</em>, and the stress is set to 0.</p>

<h3>Ticks</h3>

<p>If the character reaches the maximum stress level, he gets a <em>tick</em>, and the stress level is set to 0 again.</p>

<p>Ticks are psychological illnesses that also have an effect on the character's stats. While the character can reduce stress by resting or something similar, it is not possible to remove ticks without therapy. </p>

<p>If a character gets a tick, the following tables are rolled and the determined tick is added to the character.</p>
