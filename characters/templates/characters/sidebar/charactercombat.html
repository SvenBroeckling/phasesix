                The attacked character can dodge a melee attack as a reaction. This requires that the attacked character has an action available and can perceive the attacker. Thus, an attack from behind cannot be dodged.

                To evade an attack, the character rolls dice equal to his value in evasion. The minimum roll (5) for this is increased by the number of hits the opponent has. If the attacked person scores at least one success, he has completely dodged the attack.
